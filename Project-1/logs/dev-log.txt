-------DEVELOPMENT LOG-----------
-------SEPTEMBER 17TH-----------
*Index page
	* I started by implementing a navbar on the index page.
		* It was difficult to adjust the content: one part had to be on the
		left and another on the right. I tried using "float", but it did not work
		due to the standard positioning and displayed used by bootstrap.
		* I solved it by using the grid system
		* I took advantage of "md" and "none" and coded two alternatives for the
		right section, depending on the screen size. On small screens, it goes over
		the rest of the navbar.
	* I developed the bottom section, which will become standard for every document.
		*I mainly used the bootstrap list class.
	* I implemented a carousel with a grid system in order to have a text section and an
	image.
	* A section with featured artists was the next step
		* Several elements of the "card" class from bootstrap were used to organize
		this section.
-------SEPTEMBER 18TH-----------
*Artists page
	* A page with an accordion as a main element was developed. 4 artist profiles were
	written for it.
	* I added the navbar and the bottom section
	* A title was added and a small description.
	* The bottom section did reach the bottom part of the page when the accordion was
	expanded, but not when everything was contracted.
	* In order to solve this, I had to adjust margins and paddings between elements.
*Online Gallery
	* I implemented navbar and bottom section.
	* It was difficult to settle for a way to organize the gallery. I always had the
	intention to implement two parts: a "Featured Artworks" and "Other". I considered
	using a side-scrolling bar and tried to implement it; but settled for two
	carousels due to their ease of use.
	*However, the carousels did not look good on low resolutions. I solved this by using
	the same trick used on the navbar: made some extra carousels that would only
	show when resolution was lower than "md" and hid the original ones on these
	cases.
*Buy
	* Navbar and bottom section were implemented.
	* I divided the required information in three: buyer information, credit card
	and artwork. I used a <form> element with several inputs in order for the user
	to fill out the corresponding data. 
	* A dropdown list was added in order for the user to sellect the desired artwork.
	* A submit button was added.
*Sell
	* Navbar and bottom section were added.
	* The process was similar to the buy page. However, only one section was needed,
	asking the user for information about the art piece and adding a space for
	submitting an image of their work.
*Sign Up/Log In
	* The page was divided in two sections: sign up and log in. Forms were used to ask
	the user for information.
	* Each section had a button which sends the user back to index added. They were labeled
	"Sign Up" and "Log In".
*About Us
	* Added the navbar and bottom section
	* Wrote the titles and the platform's vision
	* Added an image below the vision
	* A contact section was added, providing the user with different e-mails to communicate
	with the organization.
	* In order to ease navigation and organize the page in accordance to the bottom section,
	each segment was given a correspondent id.
* Support
	* I inserted the navbar and bottom section.
	* The page was divided into two: "how to buy" and "how to sell".
	* I wrote the "how to buy" segment, adding a link to the "buy" page and highlighted the
	different states an artwork can be in: Up for auction, Not for auction and Auction in
	Progress.
	* I wrote the "how to sell" section, adding a link to the "sell" page and another one
	to the "contact" section in "About Us".
	* I added the pertinent ids for navigation.
* Additional Changes
	* Experimented with different colors for the web page, trying with different tones
	of blue and yellow; both as primary and secondary color. I settled with yellow as my
	main color due to it being associated with creativity.
	* Changed the color of certain elements to blue because it makes a good contrast with
	yellow.
	* Made "Submit" buttons green to differentiate them from the rest.
	* Modified the navbars and bottom sections to allow navigation.
-------SEPTEMBER 19TH-----------
* Redesigning About Us
	* I left the "contact" section mostly the same, I just had to adjust padding.
	* Readjusted the image size and added rounded borders.
	* Rearranged the "vision" section, having text and image side by side when resolution
	is larger than md, otherwise, the image goes under the text.
