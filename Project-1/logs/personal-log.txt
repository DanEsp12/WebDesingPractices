--------PERSONAL PROJECT LOG--------

--------SELF ASSESSMENT--------

I believe that two essential qualities a programmer should have are the ability to
research in order to complete their projects, and the skill to implement a design
or plan through their coding. These two characteristics shone during the development
of this web page. I was able to research by reading throughout Bootstrap's
documentation and forums such as Stack Overflow in order to code the ideas I had for
the project. One way or another, I managed to portray what I had in mind, even
though I had to change the approach several times.

I also believe that a programmer and an engineer should be able to plan before they
start their project. Plans give the structure for a product or service. If I lacked
something during the development of this web page, it was planning. Instead of
desiging my web page as I coded it, developing a layout and distributing the work
on a longer timeframe would have been an incredible advantage.

--------TEAM WORK--------

I decided to work on this project alone since it would be easier for me to organize my
time and work. In addition to this, I had more freedom on how to design and code the
web page. In spite of this advantages, I could have benefited from working in a team:
my weaknesses could have been covered by my partners and the workload would have been
much less.
